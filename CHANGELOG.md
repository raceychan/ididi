        self.driver = driver

class Repository:
    def __init__(self, db: DataBase):
        self.db = db

class UserService:
    def __init__(self, repository: Repository):
        self.repository = repository


node = DependentNode.from_node(UserService)
instance = node.build(repository=dict(db=dict(engine="sqlite")))
assert isinstance(instance, UserService)
assert isinstance(instance.repository, Repository)
assert isinstance(instance.repository.db, DataBase)
assert instance.repository.db.engine == "sqlite"
assert instance.repository.db.driver == "aiomysql"
```

- [x] feat: detect unsolveable dependency with static resolve

## version 0.2.4

Features:

- feat: support for async entry
- feat: adding `solve` as a top level api

Improvements:

- resolve / static resolve now supports factory
- better typing support for DependentNode.resolve
- dag.reset now supports clear resolved nodes

## version 0.2.5

Improvements:

- [x] better error message for node creation error
NOTE: this would leads to most exception be just NodeCreationError, and the real root cause would be wrapped in NodeCreationError.error.

This is because we build the DependencyNode recursively, and if we only raise the root cause exception without putting it in a error chain, it would be hard to debug and notice the root cause.

e.g.

```bash
.pixi/envs/test/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ididi/graph.py:416: in node
    raise NodeCreationError(factory_or_class, "", e, form_message=True) from e
E   ididi.errors.NodeCreationError: token_bucket_factory()
E   -> TokenBucketFactory(aiocache: Cache)
E   -> RedisCache(redis: Redis)
E   -> Redis(connection_pool: ConnectionPool)
E   -> ConnectionPool(connection_class: idid.Missing)
E   -> MissingAnnotationError: Unable to resolve dependency for parameter: args in <class 'type'>, annotation for `args` must be provided
```

Features:

## version 0.2.6

Feature:

- you can now use async/sync generator to create a resource that needs to be closed

```python
from ididi import DependencyGraph
dg = DependencyGraph()

@dg.node
async def get_client() -> ty.AsyncGenerator[Client, None]:
    client = Client()
    try:
        yield client
    finally:
        await client.close()


@dg.node
async def get_db(client: Client) -> ty.AsyncGenerator[DataBase, None]:
    db = DataBase(client)
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        await db.close()


@dg.entry_node
async def main(db: DataBase):
    assert not db.is_closed
```

## version 0.2.7

Improvements:

- support sync resource in async dependent
- better error message for async resource in sync function
- resource shared within the same scope, destroyed when scope is exited

## version 0.2.8

FIX:

Adding a temporary fix to missing annotation error, which would be removed in the future.

Example:

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

@dag.node
def config_factory() -> Config:
    return Config(a=1)

class Service:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config

dg.resolve(Service)
```

This would previously raise `NodeCreationError`, with root cause being `MissingAnnotationErro`, now being fixed.

## version 1.0.0

API changes:
`ididi.solve` renamed to `ididi.resolve` for better consistency with naming style.
`ididi.entry` no longer accepts `INodeConfig` as kwargs.

Feat:

DependencyGraph.use_scope to indirectly retrive nearest local
raise `OutOfScopeError`, when not within any scope.

Fix:

- now correctly recoganize if a class is async closable or not
- resolve factory with forward ref as return type.

Improvements:

- raise PositionalOverrideError when User use `dg.resolve` with any positional arguments.

- test coverages raised from 95% to 99%, where the only misses only exists in visual.py, and  are import error when graphviz not installed, and graph persist logic.

- user can directly call `Visualizer.save` without first calling `Visualizer.make_graph`.

## version 1.0.1

Improvements

- performance boost on dg.analyze

## version 1.0.2

Features

- named scope, user can now call `dg.use_scope(name)` to get a specific parent scope in current context, this is particularly useful in scenario where you have tree-structured scopes, like app-route-request.

## version 1.0.3

Fix:

- now config of `entry` node is default to reuse=False, which means the result will no longer be cached.
- better typing with `entry`

## version 1.0.4

improvements:
refactor visitor

## version 1.0.5

improvements:
DependencyGraph now supports `__contains__` operator, `a in dg` is the equivalent to `a in dg.nodes`

features:
DependencyGraph now supports a `merge` operator, example:

```py
from app.features.users import user_dg

dg = DependencyGraph()
dg.merge(user_dg)
```

you might choose to merge one or more DependencyGraph into the main graph, so that you don't have to import a single dg to register all your classes.

## version 1.0.7

adding support for python 3.13

## version 1.0.8

improvements:

now ididi will look for conflict in reusability,
For example,
when a dependency with `reuse=False` has a dependent with `reuse=True`, ididi would raise ReusabilityConflictError when statically resolve the nodes.

```bash
ididi.errors.ReusabilityConflictError: Transient dependency `Database` with reuse dependents
make sure each of AuthService -> Repository is configured as `reuse=False`
```

## version 1.0.9

- remove `import typing as ty`, `import typing_extensions as tyex` to reduce global lookup

- add an `ignore` field to node config, where these ignored param names or types will be ignored at statical resolve / resolve phase

```py
@dg.node(ignore=("name", int))
class User:
    name: str
    age: int

dg = DependencyGraph()
dg.node(ignore=("name", int))(User)
with pytest.raises(TypeError):
    dg.resolve(User)

n = dg.resolve(User, name="test", age=3)
assert n.name == "test"
assert n.age == 3
```

- fix a potential bug where when resolve dependent return None or False it could be re-resolved

- rasie error when a factory returns a builtin type

```py
@dg.node
def create_user() -> str:
    ...
```

## version 1.0.10

- fix a bug where error would happen when user use `dg.resolve` to resolve a resource factor, example:

```py
def user_factory() -> ty.Generator[User, None, None]:
    u = User(1, "test")
    yield u
dg.analyze(user_factory)
with dg.scope() as scope:
    # this would fail before 1.0.10
    u = scope.resolve(user_factory)
```

improvement
improve typing support for scope.resolve, now it recognize resource better.

## version 1.1.0

Feat:

- add a special mark so that users don't need to specifically mark `dg.node`

```py
async def create_user(user_repo: inject(repo_factory)):
    ...

# so that user does not have to explicitly declear repo_factory as a node

dg = DependencyGraph()

@dg.node
def repo_factory():
    ...
```

- support config to entry

- support DependencyGraph as dependency

```py
def get_user_service(dg: DependencyGraph) -> UserService:
    return dg.resolve(UserService)

dg.resolve(get_user_service)
# this would pass the same graph into function
```

## version 1.1.1

- remove `static_resolve` config from DependencyGraph
- remove `factory`  method frmo DependencyGraph
- add a new `self_inejct` config to DependencyGraph
- add `register_dependent` config to DependencyGraph, SyncScope, AsyncScope
- inject now supports both as annotated annotation and as default value, as well as nested annotated annotation

```py
class APP:
    def __init__(self, graph: DependencyGraph):
        self._graph = graph
        self._graph.register_dependent(self)

dg = DependencygGraph()
app = APP(graph)


@app.register
async def login(app: APP):
    assert app is app
```

## version 1.1.2

if we need a Context object in a non context manner, e.g.

```py
class Service:
    async def __aenter__(self): ...
    async def __aexit__(self, *args): ...
        
def get_service() -> Service:
    return Service()

dg.resolve(get_service)
```

- factory_type
- factory override order

improvements on `entry`

- `entry` now supports positional argument.
- `entry` now would use current scope
- 100% performance boost on `entry`
- separate `INodeConfig` and `IEntryConfig`

## version 1.1.3

Improvements:

- rename `inject` to `use`, to avoid the implication of `inject` as if it was to say only param annotated with `inject` will be injected.
whereas what it really means is which factory to use

- further optimize `entry`, now when the decorated function does not depends on resource,
it will not create a scope.

In 1.1.2

```bash
0.089221 seoncds to call call regular function create_user 100000 times
0.412887 seoncds to call entry version of create_user 100000 times
```

now at 1.1.3

```bash
0.099846 seoncds to call regular function create_user 100000 times
0.104534 seoncds to call entry version of create_user 100000 times
```

This make functions that does not depends on resource 4-5 times faster than 1.1.2
Fix:

- :sparkles: fix a bug where when a dependent with is registered with `DependencyGraph.register_dependnet`, it will still be statically resolved.

## version 1.1.4

Improvements:

- Add `DependencyGraph.should_be_scoped` api to check if a dependent type contains any resource dependency, and thus should be scoped. this is particularly useful when user needs to (dynamically) decide whether they should create the resource in a scope.

Fix:

- previously entry only check if any of its direct dependency is rousource or not, this will cause bug when any of its indirect dependencies is a resource, raise OutOfScope Exception

## version 1.1.5

Fix:

- previously only resource itself will be managed by scope, now if a dependnet depends on a resource, it will also be managed by scope.

## version 1.1.6

Fix:

- fix a bug where if user menually decorate its async generator / sync factory with contextlib.asynccontextmanager / contextmanager, `DependencyNode.factory_type` would generated as `function`.

.e.g:

```py
from typing import AsyncGenerator
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def get_client() -> AsyncGenerator[Client, None]:
    client = Client()
    try:
        yield client
    finally:
        await client.close()
```

- improvement

- use a dedicate ds to hold singleton dependent,
- improve error message for missing annotation / unresolvable dependency 

## version 1.1.7

improvements

- factory have higher priority than default value

now, for a non-builtin type, ididi will try to resolve it even with default value, 
this is because for classses that needs dependency injection, it does not make sense to have a default value in most cases, and in cases where it does, it most likely be like this

```py
class UserRepos:
    def __init__(self, db: Optional[Database] = None):
        self.db = db
```

and it make more sense to inject `Database` than to ignore it.


- global ignore with `DependencyGraph(ignore=(type))`

```py
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, d: datetime):
        self._d = d

dg = DependencyGraph(ignore=datetime)
with pytest.raises(TypeError):
    dg.resolve(Timer)
```


## version 1.2.0

improvements

- change `Scope.register_dependent` to `Scope.register_singleton` to match the change made in 1.1.7 on `DependencyGraph`. 

- positional ignore for node

```py
def test_ignore():
    dg = DependencyGraph()

    class Item:
        def __init__(self, a: int, b: str, c: int):
            self.a = a
            self.b = b
            self.c = c

    with pytest.raises(UnsolvableDependencyError):
        dg.resolve(Item)

    dg.node(ignore=(0, str, "c"))
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        dg.resolve(Item)

>>> TypeError: __init__() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'a', 'b', and 'c'
```

- partial resolve

previously, if a dependent requires a unresolvable dependency without default value, it would raise `UnsolvableDependencyError`,
this might be a problem when user wants to resolve the dependent by providing the unresolvable dependency with `dg.resolve`.

now `DependencyGraph` accepts a `partial_resolve` parameter, which would allow user to resolve a dependent with missing unsolvable-dependency.

```py
def test_graph_partial_resolve_with_dep():
    dg = DependencyGraph(partial_resolve=True)

    class Database: ...

    DATABASE = Database()

    def db_factory() -> Database:
        return DATABASE

    class Data:
        def __init__(self, name: str, db: Database = use(db_factory)):
            self.name = name
            self.db = db

    dg.node(Data)

    dg.analyze(Data)

    with pytest.raises(UnsolvableDependencyError):
        data = dg.resolve(Data)

    data = dg.resolve(Data, name="data")
    assert data.name == "data"
    assert data.db is DATABASE
```


## version 1.2.1

a quick bug fix

```py
from ididi import DependencyGraph


class Time:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name


def test_registered_singleton():
    """
    previously
    dg.should_be_scoped(dep_type) would analyze dependencies of the
    dep_type, and if it contains resolvable dependencies exception would be raised

    since registered_singleton is managed by user,
    dg.should_be_scoped(registered_singleton) should always be False.
    """
    timer = Time("1")

    dg = DependencyGraph()

    dg.register_singleton(timer)

    assert dg.should_be_scoped(Time) is False

```


## version 1.2.2

- `NodeConfig.ignore` & `GraphConfig.ignore` now supports `TypeAliasType`

only affect type checker

- remove `EntryConfig`, now `entry` share the same config as `NodeConfig`,
the only difference is now `dg.entry(reuse=True)` is possible, whereas it used to be always False, which does not really make sense, user can share the same dependencies across different calls to the entry function.


- `dg._reigster_node`, `dg._remove_node`, are now private, `dg.replace_node` is removed.
these three methods require user provide a `DependencyNode`, but we want to avoid user having to interact directly with `DependencyNode` to lower complexity.


## version 1.2.3

- change `_itypes` to `interfaces`, make it public, since it is unlikely to cause breaking change

- remove `partial_resolve` from DependencyGraph

`partial_resolve` was introduced in `1.2.0`.  it is not a good design,
it is like a global `try except`, which hides problems instead of solving them.


- `Ignore` Annotation


```py
from ididi import Ignore

class User:
    def __init__(self, name: Ignore[str]):
        self.name = name
```

which is equivalent to

```
DependencyGraph().node(ignore="name")(User)
```


both `use` and `Ignore` are designed to be user friendly alternative to `DependencyGraph.node`



## version 1.2.4


Improvements:

- minor performance gain, 60% faster for instance resolve, should resolve 0.2 million instances in 1 second, although still 40 times slower than hard-coded factory, we tried replace recursive appraoch with iterative, no luck, only tiny improvements, so we stay at recursive appraoch

Fix:
in previous patch

```py
def service_factory(
    *, db: Database = use(db_fact), auth: AuthenticationService, name: str
) -> UserService:
    return UserService(db=db, auth=auth)


def test_resolve():
    dg = DependencyGraph()

    dg.resolve(service_factory, name="aloha")
```

woud raise `UnsolvableDependencyError`, because `name` is a str without default values, 
when when we resolve it, we will first static_resolve it, which would raise error,
now if dependencies that are provided with overrides won't be statically resolved. 


## version 1.2.5

- remove `LazyDependent`, since `DependencyGraph` can inject itself to any dependencies it resolve, 
`LazyDependent` can be easily achieved by injecting `DependencyGraph` and lazy resolve

```py
from ididi import ignore

class UserRepo:
    def __init__(self, graph: DependencyGraph, db: Ignore[DataBase]=None):
        self._graph = graph
        self._db = db

    @property
    def db(self):
        return self._graph.resolve(DataBase)
```


- performance boost

25% performance increase to `DependencyGraph.resolve` compare to 1.2.4

Current implementation of dg.resolve is 17.356008 times slower than a hard-coded dependency construction.
given how much extra work ididi does resolving dependency, 
our ultimate goal would be make dg.resolve < 10 times slower than a hard-coded solution.


## version 1.2.6

- override class dependencies, entry dependencies

```py
class Repo:
    db: DataBase = use(db_factory)


def fake_db_factory()->DataBase:
    return FakeDB()

dg.node(fake_db_factory)
```

### override entry

```py
def test_entry_replace():
    dg = DependencyGraph()

    def create_user(
        user_name: str, user_email: str, service: UserService
    ) -> UserService:
        return service

    class FakeUserService(UserService): ...

    create_user = dg.entry(reuse=False)(create_user)
    create_user.replace(UserService, FakeUserService)

    res = create_user("user", "user@email.com")
    assert isinstance(res, FakeUserService)


    class EvenFaker(UserService):
        ...

    create_user.replace(service=EvenFaker)
    create_user.replace(UserService, service=EvenFaker)

    res = create_user("user", "user@email.com")
    assert isinstance(res, EvenFaker)
```


## version 1.3.0

### performance boost

**400%** performance improvements on `Graph.resolve`, by apply cache whever possible,

In previous benchmark, 
0.000558 seoncds to resolve 100 instances

ididi v1.3.0
0.000139 seoncds to resolve 100 instances




### renaming

- rename `DependencyGraph` to `Graph`
- rename `DependencyGraph.static_resolve` to `Graph.analyze`
- rename `DependencyGraph.static_resolve_all` to `Graph.analyze_nodes`

Original names are kept as alias to new names to avoid breaking changes


### typing support

- support Unpack
```py
class DataBase: ...
class Cache: ...
class Config: ...

class KWARGS(TypedDict):
    db: DataBase
    cache: Cache

class Extra(KWARGS):
    config: Config

class Repo:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Unpack[KWARGS]) -> None:
        self.db = kwargs["db"]
        self.cache = kwargs["cache"]

class SubRepo(Repo):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Unpack[Extra]):
        super().__init__(db=kwargs["db"], cache=kwargs["cache"])
        self.config = kwargs["config"]

def test_resolve_unpack():
    dg = Graph()
    repo = dg.resolve(Repo)
    assert isinstance(repo.db, DataBase)
    assert isinstance(repo.cache, Cache)
    subrepo = dg.resolve(SubRepo)
    assert isinstance(subrepo.config, Config)
```

- support Literal

```py
def test_resolve_literal():
    dg = Graph()

    class User:
        def __init__(self, name: Literal["user"] = "user"):
            self.name = name

    u = dg.resolve(User)
    assert u.name == "user"
```


### Features

```py
Graph.remove_singleton(self, dependent_type: type) -> None:
"Remove the registered singleton from current graph, return if not found"

Graph.remove_dependent(self, dependent_type: type) -> None
"Remove the dependent from current graph, return if not found"
```



## version 1.3.1

### Features

Resolve NewType


```py
from uuid import uuid4

UUID = NewType("UUID", str)


def uuid_factory() -> UUID:
    return str(uuid4())

def user_factory(user_id: UUID) -> User:
    return User(user_id=user_id)
```

Why not TypeAlias as well?

1. It does not make sense, since TypeAlias is literally an alias

A = str 

means A is the same as str, and it make no sense to resolve a str.


2. Resolving TypeAlias is not possible in python 3.9

```py
UUID = str

def uuid_factory() -> UUID:
    return uuid4()

when we try to resolve uuid_factory, the return is a type `str`,
not a `TypeAlias`.
```


## version 1.3.2

- Now when override entry dependencies  with `entryfunc.replace`, ididi will automatically analyze the override dependency

- `NodeConfig` is now immutable and hashable
- rename `Graph._analyze_entry` to `Graph.analyze_params`, 

## version 1.3.3

- `Graph.search_node`, search node by name, O(n) complexity

This is mainly for debugging purpose, sometimes you don't have access to the dependent type, but do know the name of it. example

```python
class User: ...

dg = Graph()
dg.node(User)

assert dg.search_node("User").dependent_type is User
```

This is particularly useful for type defined by NewType

```python
UserId = NewType("UserId", str)
assert dg.search_node("UserId")
```


- `Graph.override` 

a helper function to override dependent within the graph

```python
def override(self, old_dep: INode[P, T], new_dep: INode[P, T]) -> None:
```

```python
    dg = DependencyGraph()

    @dg.entry
    async def create_user(
        user_name: str, user_email: str, service: UserService
    ) -> UserService:
        return service

    @dg.node
    def user_factory() -> UserService:
        return UserService("1", 2)

    class FakeUserService(UserService): ...

    dg.override(UserService, FakeUserService)

    service_res = await create_user("1", "2")
    assert isinstance(service_res, FakeUserService)
```

Note that, if you only want to override dependency for `create_user`
you can still just use `create_user.replace(UserService, FakeUserService)`,
and such override won't affect others.


## version 1.3.4

- refactor `Scope` and `Graph` to avoid circular reference, 

## version 1.3.5

- a quick bug fix, where in 1.3.4, registered_singleton is not shared between graph and scope.

The general rule is that scope can access registered singletons and resolved instances but not vice versa.


## version 1.3.6

- Fix: `Graph.entry` no longer uses existing scope, instead, always create a new scope


## version 1.4.0

This minor focus on a small refactor on `Scope`, we like the idea that `Scope` is a temporary view of its parent `Graph`, so following change is made:

- both resource and non-resource instances created in scope will stay in the scope
- when a graph create a scope, it shares a copy of its resolved singletons and registered singletons, scope can read them, but can not modify them.

This gives a better separation between `Graph` and `Scope`.
